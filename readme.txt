Drawing Program 3 patterns implemented:

GRASP:

Static polymorphism
* Public abstract class Command 
	- This class provides several uses of a type of static polymorphism, method overloading by using this class as a base for 7 other "*Command.java" classes.
		- - public abstract Command Reverse & public abstract void Do 
Dynamic polymorphism
* Public Classes ColorCommand, CreateCommand, DeleteCommand, DrawCommand, DrawSceneCommand, MoveCommand, Selectcommand
	- These classes provide uses for a type of dynamic polymorphism, method overriding in an
	  inheritance hierarchy.
Inheritance
* Public class Circle, Rectangle, NoShape extends Shape 
	Single Inheritance
	- Public class Circle demonstrate single inheritance. Subclasses inherit the features of one
	  superclass.
